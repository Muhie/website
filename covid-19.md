## The Competition

Following guidance from the UK government and the University of Reading, we are postponing Student Robotics 2020 from the original date in April, until the **weekend of the 4th July** (subject to review mid-May).

We are considering a virtual competition, and are exploring possibilities of how this could work.

### During the competition

We will be briefing all volunteers and attendees about best hygiene practices, both in advance and on the day, ensuring they're followed throughout the competition.

We expect everyone attending the competition to follow the [guidelines][phe-guidelines] on COVID-19 from Public Health England.

## Tech Days

There are no current planned tech days before the competition. Once things have settled down, we hope to organise some.

The [forum][forum] is still a great place to get help from blueshirts and other teams, in addition to showing off your progress!

If you are looking for more in-depth support from blueshirts, you can [email us][teams-email] to request remote mentoring.
