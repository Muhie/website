## SR2023

SR2023 will have in person events.
However, we must recognise that some people still have to be cautious, to protect their own health or their friends or family.
As such, we ask that everyone follows the below requests to help ensure we all keep safe, whilst still having lots of fun with robots!

* If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, or have tested positive for COVID-19 in the 7 days beforehand (or live with someone who has) please do not attend.
* If you are able, please wear a mask.
* Please clean your hands regularly, using hand sanitizer or soap.
* Be respectful towards others' personal space.

We are keeping a close eye on government guidelines, and will continue to update this page as required.

If you have any questions please contact us at [{{ site.emails.teams }}][teams-email].
