## The Competition

### In-person compeititon

While our plan is still to run a physical competition if we can, this is looking increasingly unlikely.

The current scheduled date is the **weekend of the 4th July** (subject to review mid-May).

We will be briefing all volunteers and attendees about best hygiene practices, both in advance and on the day, ensuring they're followed throughout the competition.

We expect everyone attending the competition to follow the [guidelines][phe-guidelines] on COVID-19 from Public Health England.

### Virtual Competition

We will be running a virtual Student Robotics Competition this summer, with our initial test event being **late May / early June**. This will be a simulator-based competition. Our volunteers are working hard to make this the best possible experience for teams and spectators despite the short timescales.

We aim to keep the virtual competition rules as similar to the SR2020 game, [Two Colours]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/rules/), as possible.

Due to the nature of a virtual competition, we should be able to allow competing schools to enter additional teams.

## Assistance from volunteers

With our focus shifting to a Virtual Competition, we intend to improve our remote mentoring over the next few weeks.

The [forum][forum] is still a great place to get help from blueshirts and other teams, in addition to showing off your progress!

If you are looking for more in-depth support from blueshirts in the meantime, you can [email us][teams-email] to request remote mentoring.
