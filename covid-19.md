## The Competition

### In-person competition

In light of recent events, the physical competition will not be running.

### Virtual Competition

We will be running a virtual Student Robotics Competition this summer. More information can be found on its [event page]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/sr2020/virtual-competition/).

We aim to keep the virtual competition rules as similar to the SR2020 game, [Two Colours]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/rules/), as possible.

Due to the nature of a virtual competition, we should be able to allow competing schools to enter additional teams.

## Assistance from volunteers

With our focus shifting to a Virtual Competition, we intend to improve our remote mentoring over the next few weeks.

The [forum][forum] is still a great place to get help from blueshirts and other teams, in addition to showing off your progress!

If you are looking for more in-depth support from blueshirts in the meantime, you can [email us][teams-email] to request remote mentoring.
