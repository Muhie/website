## The Competition

**We currently intend to have the competition on the 18th and 19th April 2020 as planned**, however are actively and carefully considering whether this needs to change.

Considering this is an event for minors, we will be taking decisions with an abundance of caution.

We are in contact with Reading University Students' Union who are continually reviewing the situation, and mitigating the risks associated with Coronavirus.

The things which would prevent the competition from running are:

- If the government says we can't/shouldn't proceed
- If the venue cancels our booking
- If we can't get enough teams to come
- If we can't get enough volunteers to come
- We don't think we can offer a safe event

All of these are being actively reviewed, and steps are being taken to mitigate these where possible.

### In the case of the competition going ahead

We will be briefing all volunteers and attendees about best hygiene practices, both in advance and on the day, ensuring they're followed throughout the competition.

We expect everyone attending the competition to follow the [guidelines][phe-guidelines] on COVID-19 from Public Health England.

### In the case of the competition being postponed

We are considering weekends in late June / early July as alternatives for the competition. We will be surveying team leaders to ensure we select the most appropriate date.

## Tech Days

There are no current planned tech days before the current competition date in April.

If the competition is postponed, we will try and schedule some additional ones closer to the new event date.

The [forum][forum] is still a great place to get help from blueshirts and other teams, in addition to showing off your progress!

If you are looking for more in-depth support from blueshirts, you can [email us][teams-email] to request remote mentoring.
