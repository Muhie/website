We will keep this page updated with new information as it becomes available.

## The Competition

Following guidance from the UK government and the University of Reading, **we will need to postpone Student Robotics 2020** from the original date in April, until some time late June / early July.

We have requested feedback from team leaders and volunteers to help select the most appropriate date.

### During the competition

We will be briefing all volunteers and attendees about best hygiene practices, both in advance and on the day, ensuring they're followed throughout the competition.

We expect everyone attending the competition to follow the [guidelines][phe-guidelines] on COVID-19 from Public Health England.

## Tech Days

There are no current planned tech days before the current competition date in April. Once things have settled down, we can organise some.

The [forum][forum] is still a great place to get help from blueshirts and other teams, in addition to showing off your progress!

If you are looking for more in-depth support from blueshirts, you can [email us][teams-email] to request remote mentoring.
