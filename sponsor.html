        Student Robotics is looking for new sponsors to help us fulfil our mission.
        The support from our sponsors will make it possible to sustain our programme
        and continue to run free to enter competitions that attract students from
        a wide range of schools and colleges. By partnering with us, you will be
        able to increase your organisation or product awareness with the next
        generation of engineers.

      <div class="row">
        <div class="column m-6-12">
          <p class="question">Who can join a team?</p>
          <p>
            Teams usually consist of 4-6 students aged 16-18, plus an adult
            team-leader who is able to take responsibility for the competitors;
            usually a teacher. However, the team doesn't necessarily need to
            represent a school, any group of 16-18 year-olds, with a responsible
            adult, can enter.
          </p>
          <p class="question">How much does it cost?</p>
          <p>
            Thanks to our sponsors, teams can enter the competition for free.
            Teams are loaned a Student Robotics kit, which we reclaim at the
            competition. While this kit includes the electronics to make the
            robot function, it does not include any motors, sensors or other
            materials to build the robot itself.
          </p><p>
            Teams' costs are typically split between transport to and from
            events and the materials for their robot. The latter is often around
            £75, though teams are often able to re-use components such as
            motors from year to year.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column m-6-12">
          <p class="question">Do team leaders need any technical skills?</p>
          <p>
            No, team leaders don't need any technical skills. Thanks to our
            volunteers, we try to give all of our teams mentors. We also have
            the forums, and we put on tech days to help teams tackle problems.
            Team leaders only need to make sure teams get help from these
            channels when needed.
          </p>
          <p class="question">How much time does it take?</p>
          <p>
            Kickstart and Tech Days are usually limited to one day each, while
            the competition takes a weekend. Aside from these, the amount of
            time invested is usually up to the team to decide. Many teams work
            on their robot in weekly after-school sessions, this varies with the
            academic year.
          </p>
          <p class="question">Where can I get support?</p>
          <p>
            Teams can get support from various channels. We aim to provide as
            many teams with mentors as we can. For teams without mentors, there
            are always the forums.
