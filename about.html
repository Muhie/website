            We challenge teams of 16 to 18 year-olds to design, build and develop
            autonomous robots to compete in our annual competition. After announcing
            the year's game, we give teams six months to engineer their creations.
            We mentor teams throughout this time, as well as supply them with a kit
            which provides a framework they can build their robot around. Thanks to
            our sponsors, we provide this all for free to our teams.

            As a community of engineers and educators, we are entirely focused
            on our mission. We measure our effectiveness on the experience
            we provide to students, and the number of students we can reach, and
            we want every penny that we receive to go into improving the experience
            for our competitors and volunteers. That's why we're a fully
            registered charity in England and Wales.
