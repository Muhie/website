The Student Robotics Competition marks the ultimate stage of SR2021, showcasing months of preparation. Our teams will work hard to push their virtual robots to the limit, competing against each other, and evolving their strategies to gain the upper hand.

Teams will have to submit their code to us by 8pm BST on Friday 30th April using our [code submitter](https://studentrobotics.org/code-submitter/).
