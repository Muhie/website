Kickstart is the event which kicks off a competition year. The game and rules will
be announced, the competition simulator will be shown off to teams and of course any
questions you have will be answered. Kickstart will be streamed live on
**21st November 2020 at 13:00 (GMT)**, aiming to finish around 16:00.

The simulator will be based in [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/#download). The download
is large, and we recommend downloading it before the event to ensure you can get started
immediately. Information on downloading our simulation will be made available through
[the docs](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/simulator/) during the event.

During the event, we recommend setting up a call or video chat for you and your team to
communicate and collaborate, both to share ideas and discuss potential questions.

There's still time to [sign up][sign-up] if you have't already! Deadline for entries is the 19th November 2020.

Our live-stream will start at 1pm GMT: [Watch live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQOgo0Gh4iA)
