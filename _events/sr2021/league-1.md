This is the first league round of this year's competition and the first time we get to see the robots in action! Our teams will work hard to push their virtual robots to the limit, competing against each other, and evolving their strategies to gain the upper hand.

Code submission will be due at 8am GMT: [Submit your code](https://studentrobotics.org/code-submitter/)

Our live-stream will start at noon GMT.
