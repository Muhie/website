This is the fourth league round of this year's competition and the last chance teams get to test their strategies before the knockouts! Our teams will work hard to push their virtual robots to the limit, competing against each other, and evolving their strategies to gain the upper hand.

Teams will have to submit their code to us by 8pm BST on Friday 23rd using our [code submitter](https://studentrobotics.org/code-submitter/).
