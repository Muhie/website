This is the second league round of this year's competition and we'll get to see what lessons teams have learnt from their first time in the arena! Our teams will work hard to push their virtual robots to the limit, competing against each other, and evolving their strategies to gain the upper hand.

Our live-stream will start at noon GMT: [Watch live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwW5Oz30gbE)
