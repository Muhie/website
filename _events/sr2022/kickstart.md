Kickstart is the event which kicks off a competition year, where the game will
be announced.

Although the simulator-based activities worked well last year, this year weâ€™re excited to give students a chance at building fully autonomous physical robots again.

During the event, we recommend setting up a call or video chat for you and your team to communicate and collaborate, both to share ideas and discuss potential questions.
