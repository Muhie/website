Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their robot with lots of help available. Theyâ€™re also an opportunity to see how other teams are doing or get more direct help with their robots.

The aim of this day is to help teams out by having guaranteed presence from us blueshirts. We'll be around to answer questions about the competition, give kit support, and assist with strategy ideas.

## Schedule

The day will start with an introduction, going through the plan for the day, introducing teams.

We'll then break out, where teams can work on their robots with direct guidance from blueshirts.

Later in the day, we'll come back for "lightnings talks", a chance for teams to show off the progress they've made on their robot both today and in the competition so far, as well as brag about how good their robot and team is.

After this, we plan on talking through some of the pitfalls we often see with robots in competitions, and answer any questions competitors may have.

## Location

This tech day will be happening on our [Discord](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/team_admin/discord) server.
