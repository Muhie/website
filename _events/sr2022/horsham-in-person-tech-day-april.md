Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their
robot with lots of help available. They're also an opportunity to see how other
teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

We provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as well
as volunteers able to help you with your kits and hands-on guidance with your
robots.

Spaces are limited to about 20 people, so be sure to [let us know][signup] by
Friday 25th March 2022 if you'd like to attend. We'll confirm up to 5 spaces per
team (including supervisor) as soon as we can and may be able to offer more
spaces after the deadline.

At the request of the venue, power tools and paint may not be used at this Tech Day.
