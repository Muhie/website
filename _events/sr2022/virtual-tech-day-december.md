Tech Days are opportunities for teams to get help if they're struggling with a
technical issue, and a controlled environment for students to make more
progress on their robots. They're also an opportunity to see how well they're
doing in comparison to other teams.

Our SR2022 December Tech Day is being hosted on our Discord server.
