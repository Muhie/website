The Student Robotics Competition marks the grand finale of SR2023. Showcasing the months of preparation our teams have put in, robots will be pushed to their limits, time critical repairs will be made, and invaluable problem solving skills will be gained. We will finish the weekend with our knockout where the best robots will be named victorious.
