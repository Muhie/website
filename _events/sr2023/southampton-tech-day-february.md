Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their
robot with lots of help available. They're also an opportunity to see how other
teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

We provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as well
as volunteers able to help you with your kits and hands-on guidance with your
robots.

Please [let us know][tech-day-signup] by Friday 27th January 2023 if you'd like to attend.

At the request of the venue:

* any power tools must be PAT tested,
* paint may not be used, and
* soldering irons may not be used

**Please bring your laptops!**

## Directions

Once on the Boldrewood campus, follow the signs to Building 176 and then look
for the signage for Student Robotics.

* How to [get to campus][soton-campus-directions]
* [On-campus directions][soton-directions] (and parking)
* [Where to find food][soton-food-map]. There is a separate space on the ground
  floor where food may be consumed. Food is scarce in the Tech Day location, so
  we recommend either ordering food in or taking packed lunches.
