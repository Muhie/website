The Student Robotics Virtual Competition is the first stage of the SR2023 competition. Our teams will work hard to push their virtual robots to the limit, competing against each other, and evolving their strategies to gain the upper hand. Whilst they're competing in a [virtual arena](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/simulator/), teams are competing for real league points, which could make all the difference in the [final competition](./competition.md).

Teams will have to submit their code to us by 8pm BST on Friday 24th using our [code submitter](https://studentrobotics.org/code-submitter/).
