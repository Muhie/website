Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their
robot with lots of help available. They're also an opportunity to see how other
teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

We provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as well
as volunteers able to help you with your kits and hands-on guidance with your
robots.

London Tech Days will only run of there is sufficient interest. Spaces are
limited to six teams, so be sure to [let us know][tech-day-signup] by Wednesday
30th November 2022 if you'd like to attend.

**Please bring your laptops!**
