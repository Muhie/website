Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their
robot with lots of help available. They're also an opportunity to see how other
teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

We provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as well
as volunteers able to help you with your kits and hands-on guidance with your
robots.

**Due to unforeseen circumstances this Tech Day will not be running in London.**

Instead we are planning to run a [Virtual Tech Day][virtual-tech-day] on the
Saturday instead.
