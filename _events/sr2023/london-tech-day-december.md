Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their
robot with lots of help available. They're also an opportunity to see how other
teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

We provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as well
as volunteers able to help you with your kits and hands-on guidance with your
robots.

At this Tech Day we will have the props available for teams to run through the
Kickstart [microgames][microgames] if they have not done so already.

Due to limited space in the venue, we only have room for six teams at this Tech
Day. Signup is now closed and teams who have places will have received an email
confirming their place.

At the request of the venue: paint, hand tools which create mess, or power tools
may not be used at this Tech Day.

**Please bring your laptops!**
