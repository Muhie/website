Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their
robot with lots of help available. They're also an opportunity to see how other
teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

We provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as well
as volunteers able to help you with your kits and hands-on guidance with your
robots.

Please [let us know][tech-day-signup] by Friday 27th January 2023 if you'd like to attend.

**Please bring your laptops!**

## Directions

Once on campus, follow the signs to Building 25 and then look for the signage
for Student Robotics.
