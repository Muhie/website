Tech Days are opportunities for teams to get help if they're struggling with a
technical issue, and a controlled environment for students to make more
progress on their robots. They're also an opportunity to see how well they're
doing in comparison to other teams.

London Tech Days will only run if there is sufficient interest. Spaces are
limited to six teams, so be sure to [let us know][teams-contact] if you'd like
to attend. For this Tech Day, please express your interest by Wednesday 27th
November.

**Due to lack of interest this Tech Day will not be running.**
