The Student Robotics Competition marks the ultimate stage of SR2020, showcasing the months of preparation. Our teams will work hard to push their virtual robots to the limit, competing against eachother, and evolving their strategies to gain the upper hand.

The virtual competition will take place over a few weekend sessions in July, with a few weekends of league matches, and a knockout final where the best bots will be named victorious.

**Stay tuned for more information.**
