The Student Robotics Competition marks the ultimate stage of SR2020, showcasing the months of preparation. Our teams will work hard to push their virtual robots to the limit, competing against each other, and evolving their strategies to gain the upper hand.

The virtual competition will take place over three weekend sessions in July:

Weekend         | Matches
----------------|---------
11th July 2020  | League
18th July 2020  | League
25th July 2020  | Knockout

Teams will submit their robot code in advance and the simulated matches
will be broadcast via a live stream over each weekend.

**Stay tuned for more information.**
