Tech days are opportunities for teams to get help if they're struggling with a
technical issue, and is a controlled environment for students to make more
progress on their robots. It's also an opportunity to see how well they're doing
in comparison to other teams.

The Southampton tech days take advantage of the facilities of the University of
Southampton, and usually involve a tour of the facilities.
