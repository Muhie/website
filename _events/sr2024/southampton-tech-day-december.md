Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their
robot with lots of help available. They're also an opportunity to see how other
teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

We provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as well
as volunteers able to help you with your kits and hands-on guidance with your
robots.

Please [let us know][tech-day-signup] by Friday 1st December 2023 if you'd like
to attend. We will begin confirming places from Wednesday 8th November 2023.

At the request of the venue:

* any electrical equipment must be PAT tested,
* paint may not be used, and
* soldering irons may not be used

**Please bring your laptops!**
