The Student Robotics Virtual Competition is the first stage of the SR2024 competition. Teams will push their virtual robots to the limit, competing against each other in a [virtual arena](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/simulator/), teams are competing for real league points, which could make all the difference in the [final competition]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/sr2024/competition/).

Teams will have to submit their code to us by 6pm GMT on Thursday 7th using our [code submitter](https://studentrobotics.org/code-submitter/).
