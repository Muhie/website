Kickstart is the event which kicks off a competition year. The structure of the
competition, the game rules will be announced, kits will have been shipped to
you and of course any questions you have will be answered. While we will be
streaming the event we strongly encourage teams to meet up and watch the stream
together. This is a great way to get to know your team mates and start working
together on the kit.
