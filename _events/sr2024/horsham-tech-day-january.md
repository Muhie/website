Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their
robot with lots of help available. They're also an opportunity to see how other
teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

We provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as well
as volunteers able to help you with your kits and hands-on guidance with your
robots.

Spaces are limited to four teams, so be sure to [let us know][tech-day-signup]
by Friday 12th January 2024 if you'd like to attend. We will begin confirming
places from Wednesday 13th December 2023.

**Please bring your laptops!**
