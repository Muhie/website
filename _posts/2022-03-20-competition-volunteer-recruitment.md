title: Sign Up To Help With The Competition
description: We're looking for volunteers to help at the SR2022 competition
---

On the 23rd and 24th of April, at Southampton University, we are holding our annual competition. Teams of 16-19 year olds will bring the fully autonomous robots they've built from around the UK and compete against each other.

As a volunteer you'd be doing things like, helping competitors problem solve, making sure robots show up to their matches on time, scoring matches and other odd jobs. No technical experience required - we can find a role for everyone!

If you're interested in helping out please (sign up on this form)[https://forms.gle/2QHQLKVTyTRq7t9B8], or feel free to email (competition-team@studentrobotics.org)[mailto:competition-team@studentrobotics.org] for more information.
