#### How did you first get involved in (competing with) Student Robotics?

I was a competitor in Student robotics in 2014 and 2015, while I was at Peter Symonds College, Winchester (PSC). During both years I was involved with all aspects of the robot build, alongside running our social media accounts and moved on to lead the team in 2015. After starting at the University of Southampton, I volunteered to help out at the competition. 

#### What do you do as a volunteer for Student Robotics?

I currently mentor 2 teams helping them get the most out of Student Robotics. Alongside this, I am involved in the Kit Team, which I was on the committee for previously and helped with the charity re-organisation in 2019.

#### What is your favourite part about volunteering for Student Robotics?

Seeing students achieve amazing things from engineering that they never thought was possible. Student robotics is the reason I ended up going into engineering, and I hope to help the next generation see that engineering really is for anyone and everyone!

#### What do you do for a living?

I currently work as an electronics consultant for The Technology Partnership (TTP), Europe's leading technology and product development company. TTP works closely with its clients to create disruptive products based on advances in technology and engineering innovation. TTP’s technology lies behind many products and processes in areas as diverse as communications, digital printing, instrumentation, consumer & industrial products, biotechnology, medical devices, cleantech and security systems.

#### What life advice would you give to yourself aged 16-18 knowing what you know now?

Don’t be afraid to ask. Sometimes things are presented to you on a silver platter, this could be opportunities or knowledge, other times they are not. Don’t be afraid to put yourself out there and ask, the worst thing that can happen is they say no, and that isn't something to be afraid of.
