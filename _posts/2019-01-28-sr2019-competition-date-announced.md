title: SR2019 Competition Dates 
---

We're pleased to announce this year's competition dates.

The Student Robotics 2019 competition will be held at Southampton University on the 6th and 7th of April 2019.

These two days mark the ultimate stage of SR2019, showcasing the months of preparation. Our teams will work hard to push their robots to the limit and quickly make repairs between league matches. We will finish the weekend with the finals where the best bots will be named victorious.

Teams will be notified of how they can acquire tickets in the coming days. As usual, this will require attendees to fill out a media consent form.

For more information, please see the competition [event page][competition-event].

See you there!
