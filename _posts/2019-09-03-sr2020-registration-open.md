title: Registration opens for Student Robotics 2020
---

We're excited to announce that registration for the 2020 season of Student
Robotics is now open!

The competition cycle will start with an expected three kickstart events at
which the game will be announced and the kits handed out to teams.

While the details for kickstart are not yet available, the events are expected
to take place on the same weekend in mid-late October and be hosted:

 * in Aldgate, London
 * in Cambridge
 * in Southampton

The competition, which will take place over two days in around April 2020, will
see the robots compete through a league stage and a seeded knockout. As usual,
the prizes will recognise not only the teams which come top in the knockouts,
but also those who excel in other ways.

Details of the game and prizes will be revealed at kickstart. Details of the
kickstart and competition events will be published when they are available.
We expect to confirm places at the end of September.

will go fast.

We look forward to seeing your teams!
