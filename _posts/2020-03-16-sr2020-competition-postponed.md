title: Student Robotics 2020 Postponed
---

Following guidance from the UK government and the University of Reading, **we will need to postpone Student Robotics 2020** from the original date in April, until some time late June / early July.

We are currently investigating the following dates for the competition:

- 27th - 28th June
- 4th - 5th July
- 11th - 12th July

The event will still take place over a weekend, at the University of Reading.

We have requested feedback from team leaders and volunteers to help select the most appropriate date.

We hope to confirm the updated date in the next week, so watch this space!

You can still find the latest updates on our [COVID-19 updates page]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid-19/).
