title: Team TODO_TLA lead the league after the first weekend of matches
---

After the first 24 matches, team TODO_TLA from TODO_SCHOOL head up the league
leaderboard with X points. They're closely followed by teams from TODO_SCHOOL
and TODO_SCHOOL.

The league matches provide a proving ground for all the teams' hard work over
the past few months in preparing their robot code. There is also a prize for the
rookie team which scores the best in the league, which teams TODO_TLA and TODO_TLA are
currently best placed for.

However with another 24 matches next weekend, there's all to play for and these
positions could all change.

If you would like to catch up on this weekend's livestreamed matches, they're
available on Youtube:

* [Saturday League](TODO)
* [Sunday League](TODO)

We look forward to seeing you over the next two weekends for the continuation of
the SR2020 Virtual Competition.
