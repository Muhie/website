title: Team TODO_TLA lead the league after the first weekend of matches
---

After the first 24 matches, team TODO_TLA from TODO_SCHOOL head up the league
leaderboard with X points. They're closely followed by teams from TODO_SCHOOL
and TODO_SCHOOL.

The league matches provide a proving ground for all the teams' hard work over
the past few months in preparing their robot code. There is also a prize for the
rookie team which scores the best in the league, which teams TODO_TLA and TODO_TLA are
currently best placed for.

The teams now have a week to work on and improve their code before another 24
league numbers are played over the course of next weekend. As we've seen with
the changes in the league from Sunday's matches, this means there's still all to
play for.

If you would like to catch up on this weekend's livestreamed matches, they're
available on Youtube:

We look forward to seeing you over the next two weekends for the continuation of
the SR2020 Virtual Competition.
