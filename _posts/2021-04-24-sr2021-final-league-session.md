title: The SR2021 Final League Session comes to a close
---

With the final 36 matches of the SR2021 League complete, team MAI from Gymnasium
Markt Indersdorf head up the leaderboard. They have managed to knock the teams from
Hills Road Sixth Form College out of the top spot. Of our rookie teams, teams WER
and SPA are looking to be the ones to watch though we've seen amazing progress
from all teams and anything could change before the finals. They are definetly
much too close to close call!

Module â…£ totally redisigned the arena, while keeping the same game mechanics, meaning teams
have had to make some large changes to their strategy to ensure continued success. Our new
larger arena includes more territories, moveable obstacles, and new kinds of territories
worth varying points.

Now the league stage of the competition is over the Knockouts await.
There will be one play-in match between the bottom two teams in order to reduce
them to one team followed by an ordinary single-elimination knockout of the 16
remaining teams. Pairings are arranged such that the higher the position in the league
the easier your path to the final.

If you would like to catch up on any of the matches so far, our livestreams are
available on YouTube:
