title: The SR2021 Final League Session comes to a close
---

With the final 36 matches of the SR2021 League complete, team MAI from Gymnasium
Markt Indersdorf head up the leaderboard. They have managed to knock the teams from
Hills Road Sixth Form College out of the top spot. Of our rookie teams, teams WER
and SPA are looking to be the ones to watch though we've seen amazing progress
from all teams. With just an six point spread between the top nine teams the
finals are definetly much too close to close call!

Module â…£, which is final iteration of this years game, was played for the
first time today. This module totally redesigned the arena, while keeping
the same game mechanics, meaning teams have had to make some large changes
to their strategy to ensure continued success. Our new larger arena includes
more territories, moveable obstacles, and new kinds of territories worth
varying points.

Now the league stage of the competition is over the Knockouts await.
The knockout will consist of play-in matches to identify the top 16 teams
followed by four rounds of single-elimination matches. Third place will be
decided by a play-off between the teams which place second in their semi-final
matches. Pairings are arranged such that the higher a team's position in the league
the easier their path to the final.

If you would like to catch up on any of the matches so far, our livestreams are
available on YouTube:
