title: Student Robotics 2020 New Provisional Competition Date
---

## Provisional Competition Date

After surveying our SR2020 teams and volunteers, we have selected the **weekend of the 4th July 2020** to be the most appropriate date for the competition.

The COVID-19 situation changes often, so we will re-evaluate in mid-May.

## Virtual Competition

We are also considering a virtual competition, and are exploring possibilities of how this could work. ~~This virtual competition would likely be held on our original dates of 18th and 19th April 2020.~~ We aim to keep the virtual competition rules as similar to Two Colours as possible. This is to ensure that teams can use the code they have been working on since Kickstart.
