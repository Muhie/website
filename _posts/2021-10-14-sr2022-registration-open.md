title: Registration opens for Student Robotics 2022
---

We're excited to announce that registration for the 2022 season of Student
Robotics is now open!

This year we're delighted to return to an in person event after a couple
of years of virtual competitions due to COVID.

The competition cycle will start with a live streamed [Kickstart event][kickstart]
on 13th November at which the game will be announced and the competition introduced.

The competition, which will take place sometime roughly around April 2021, will
see the robots compete through a league stage and a seeded knockout. As usual,
the prizes will recognise not only the teams which come top in the knockouts,
but also those who excel in other ways.

Details of the game and prizes will be revealed at Kickstart. Details of the
Kickstart can be found on its [event page][kickstart] and competition events
will be published when they are available. We expect to confirm places before
Kickstart.

If you would like a chance to [compete][compete] in Student Robotics 2022,
please fill in the [entry form][entry-form] with the required information.

We look forward to seeing your teams!
