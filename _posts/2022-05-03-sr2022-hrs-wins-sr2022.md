That’s it for Student Robotics 2022! [Hills Road Sixth Form
College](https://www.hillsroad.ac.uk/) took the crown in an intense showdown
against [Cirencester College](https://www.cirencester.ac.uk/), [Brockenhurst
College](https://www.brock.ac.uk/), and [Queen Mary’s
College](https://www.qmc.ac.uk/). It was fantastic to finally see robots
in-person again after two years of being virtual. The ingenuity and engineering
displayed by all our teams was incredible, and we’re delighted with the
performances we saw over the weekend.

## The Game: This Way Up

This Way Up challenged robots to collect the most tin cans from the arena and
ensure they were the correct way up for maximum points. Robots could detect a
can’s orientation by the red insulating band along the bottom. When in a robot’s
scoring zone, correctly oriented cans were worth three points, upside down cans
were worth one point, and cans lying on their side were worth nothing. Tin cans
on the arena floor started upside down, but those on the raised platform in the
centre were already the right way up, making them harder to get but easier to
score points. The states of the cans were recorded at the end of the matches,
and the teams were scored accordingly.

## League Matches

The teams played 91 league matches, over which they improved their robots and
tweaked their strategies while earning league points. The teams’ positions in
the league seeded the knockouts, with the top 8 teams heading straight to the
quarter-finals and the rest having to enter qualifier matches to proceed. Teams
had various designs, from an Archimedes’ screw, to advanced computer vision, to
even flipping the entire robot with cans inside! Particularly notable were
[Royal Grammar School Guildford](https://www.rgsg.co.uk/) for their use of
rotary encoders and an accelerometer for a closed-loop control system and
Cirencester College for their conveyor belt mechanism with integrated hopper.

## Knockout Matches

Throughout the knockouts, Brockenhurst College emerged as a bit of an underdog.
Placing only 16th in the league, their robot managed to get itself all the way
to the finals.

There was also some drama in Quarter Final 3. The robot from [Hertswood
Academy](https://www.hertswoodacademy.org/) lost its code USB stick with just a
minute and a half of the match remaining! Luckily the robot continued operating
but collided with the robot from [Calday Grange Grammar
School](https://www.calday.co.uk/).

## The Final

After progressing through all the knockout matches, four teams were left to face
each other in the final: Brockenhurst College, Cirencester College, Hills Road
Sixth Form College and Queen Mary’s College. Having scored the most game points
of all teams in the league, Queen Mary’s College were a favourite going into the
final. All was going well until, with just under a minute left, disaster struck.
Instead of depositing cans into their scoring zone, Queen Mary’s College’s robot
got stuck driving into the arena wall. Unfortunately, their robot couldn’t
recover from this. This gave Brockenhurst College the chance to get a can in
their scoring zone, ending the match with equal points to Queen Mary’s College.
This tie was broken using the position of teams within the league, leading to
Queen Mary’s College taking second place and Brockenhurst College third.

## Results

After a close match in the final, Hills Road Sixth Form College managed to beat
the competition and win the Student Robotics 2022 competition, closely followed
by Queen Mary’s College in second and Brockenhurst College in third.

The Committee Award is given to the team that displays the most extraordinary
ingenuity in the design of their robot. As engineers, we appreciate elegance,
simplicity, and robust engineering. This year, the committee award was given to
Queen Mary’s College for their elegant use of a screw to rotate the cans they
collected within the robot. They would collect up to four cans and then eject
these out the back of the robot when they returned to their scoring zone.

We’re always delighted to welcome new teams to Student Robotics and understand
how big a challenge it can be without prior experience. To recognise this
additional challenge, we award the Rookie Award to the highest placed newcomer
in the league, celebrating their incredible achievement. This year’s recipient
was Abingdon School with their streamlined grabber and advanced can detection
system using computer vision.

We award the Robot and Team Image Award to the team that presents themselves in
the most outstanding way. This year, our teams rose to the challenge, and we saw
some fantastic themes! We loved [Haberdashers'
School](https://www.habsboys.org.uk/)'s Grease theme, but we decided to give the
Robot and Team Image award to Hills Road Sixth Form College for their hilarious
“Ducktor Who” theme. All team members attended dressed as classic Dr Who
characters, and their robot was topped with a big red duck which acted as their
power button.

Through social media, teams can share the problems they’re facing as well as
their designs and successes. A few teams stood out to us this year with their
regular updates on social media, but the winner of the Online Presence Award is
[Hampton School](https://hamptonschool.org.uk/) and [Lady Eleanor Holles
School](https://www.lehs.org.uk/) for their consistent and high-quality posts,
all collated on the team’s website.

## Thank You

This year’s competition would not have been possible without all of our amazing
sponsors. Their generous support allows us to make Student Robotics free to
enter and help us continue in our mission to bring the excitement of engineering
and the challenge of coding to young people through robotics.

## Notes to editors

Student Robotics is an annual robotics competition for 16-19 year-olds in the UK
and Europe. It was founded in 2006 by university students and is free to enter
thanks to our [sponsors][sponsor] and [many volunteers][volunteers]. Since it
was first run in 2008, the final competition has grown from one room at the
University of Southampton[^1] to the UK's biggest autonomous robotics
competition.

[^1]: Student Robotics is independent from the University of Southampton.

At the start of the academic year, teams are given a kit containing custom-made
electronics at a Kickstart event, where the game for the year is announced. They
then have until the Easter holiday to build fully-autonomous robots, which will
compete against each other in the final competition. They are supported by
volunteer mentors, and software to assist them in programming their robots is
provided.
