title: Registration opens for Student Robotics 2023
---

We're excited to announce that registration for the 2023 season of Student
Robotics is now open!

The competition cycle will start with in-person [kickstart events][kickstart] at
locations near teams. During the event the game and the structure of the
competition will be announced and kits handed out to teams.

While the details for kickstart are not yet available, the events are expected
to take place on the same weekend in late October.

The competition year will culminate in an in-person competition over two days in
early April 2023, which will see the robots compete through a league stage and a
seeded knockout. As usual the prizes will recognise not only the teams which
come top in the knockouts, but also those who excel in other ways.

Details of the game and prizes will be revealed at kickstart. Details of the
kickstart and competition events will be published when they are available.
We expect to confirm places at the end of September.

If you would like a chance to [compete][compete] in Student Robotics 2023,
please fill in the [entry form][entry-form] with the required information.
Places are limited, so sign up soon to avoid disappointment.

We look forward to seeing your teams!
