title: SR2022 Game Announced
---

Student Robotics 2022 was Kickstarted on Saturday on our [livestream][livestream]. It was great to see the excitement building for our first in-person competition since SR2019.

Our game this year, _This Way Up_, challenges teams to collect the most tin cans from the arena and ensure that they're up the right way for maximum points. When in a team's scoring zone, correctly oriented cans are worth 3 points, upside down cans are worth one point, and cans lying on their side are worth nothing. However, not all cans are created equal: Tin cans on the arena floor start upside down, but those on the raised platform in the centre are already the right way up, making them harder to get but easier to score points with. Our teams can detect a cans orientation with an insulating band along the bottom - how they choose to use this is up to them! Teams are scored at the end of the match for collecting the most points. Full details, including the prizes available this year, are available in the [rulebook][rules].

This year's teams have already been strategising their approach, and we can't wait to see their progress over the year!

If you weren’t able to attend Kickstart this year, or would like a recap, you can:

- watch our [livestream][livestream] where we explain the game and how this year's competition will work.
- download [the presentation][presentation] in which we explain this year’s game and how the competition is running this year.
- download [the microgames][microgames] which are small activities designed to let you become familiar with the Student Robotics simulator.

We look forward to seeing your progress!
