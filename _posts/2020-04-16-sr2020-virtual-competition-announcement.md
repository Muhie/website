title: Student Robotics 2020 Virtual Competition Announcement
---

## Virtual Competition

We will be running a virtual Student Robotics Competition this summer. Our volunteers are hard at work developing a simulator-based solution for teams to compete in. 

We aim to keep the virtual competition rules as similar to the SR2020 game, [Two Colours](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/rules/), as possible.

Due to the nature of a virtual competition, we should be able to allow competing schools to enter additional teams.

Our first test event is scheduled for late May / early June. We're really excited to see where this goes.

## Physical Competition

While our plan is still to run a physical competition if we can, this is looking increasingly unlikely. Please stay tuned for updates.

You can still find the latest updates on our [COVID-19 updates page]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid-19/).
