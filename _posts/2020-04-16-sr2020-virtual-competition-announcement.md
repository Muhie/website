title: Student Robotics 2020 Virtual Competition Announcement
---

## Virtual Competition

We will be running a virtual Student Robotics Competition this summer. Our volunteers are hard at work developing a simulator-based solution for teams to compete in. 

We aim to keep the virtual competition rules as similar to the SR2020 game, [Two Colours]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/rules/), as possible.

Our first test event is scheduled for late May / early June

## Physical Competition

We are also considering a virtual competition, and are exploring possibilities of how this could work. ~~This virtual competition would likely be held on our original dates of 18th and 19th April 2020.~~ We aim to keep the virtual competition rules as similar to Two Colours as possible. This is to ensure that teams can use the code they have been working on since Kickstart.

You can still find the latest updates on our [COVID-19 updates page]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid-19/).
