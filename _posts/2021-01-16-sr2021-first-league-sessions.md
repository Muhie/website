title: SR2021 First League Session a Great Success!
---

After the first 36 matches of the SR2021 Competition, team HRS3 from
Hills Road Sixth Form College head up the initial league leaderboard with a
staggering 82 game points. They're closely followed by the other 3 Hills Road
teams as well as one of our rookie teams We Robots.

The league matches provide a proving ground for all the teams' hard work over
the past few months in preparing their robot code. There is also a prize for the
rookie team which scores the best in the league, which both the We Robots team
and Harris Westminster Sixth Form Team 1 are currently well placed for.

At the end of the league we announced to teams the details of our second game
module. This sees the territories, that teams must claim to gain points,
have 'links' added between them. Coupled with a new restriction that prevents
robots claiming territories unless they can form a chain back to thier starting
zone, this makes for an intersting problem for teams to solve.

The teams now have three weeks to work on and improve their code before another
36 league matches are played over the course of next league schedule. Given this is
only our first league session there is still everything to play for.

If you would like to catch up on this weekend's livestreamed matches, they're

We look forward to seeing you over the coming months for the continuation of
the SR2021 Competition.
