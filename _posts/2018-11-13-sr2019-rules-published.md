We had a successful Kickstart on Saturday and it was great to see the excited teams getting familiar with our kit.

Our game this year is called Caldera in which teams need to claim the most zones by placing more of their tokens than the other robots within the zone boundaries. ([full rules][rules])

We’ve already seen the teams come up with some innovative solutions and it’s going to be interesting to see how they develop.

All competitors should now have user accounts for our website. This includes our [IDE][ide] for teams to write their code in. This also includes [our forums][forums] which are a great place to brainstorm with other teams and discuss any problems which you run into.

(See [our docs][account-info] if you are not able to log in.)

If you weren’t able to attend Kickstart this year, or would like a recap, you can download:
- [The presentation][presentation] in which we explain this year’s game and how the competition is running this year.
- [The microgames][microgames] which are small activities designed to let you become familiar with the Student Robotics kit.
