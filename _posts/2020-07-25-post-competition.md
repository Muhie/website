Congratulations to JAMDynamics who take victory in a tie-breaker match after a
strong performance in the league and knockout stages.

The Challenge: *Two Colours*

Our game this year, _Two Colours_, challenged teams retrieve gold or silver
coloured tokens from on and around a raised platform in the centre of the arena.
Having these tokens within their scoring zone (i.e. their corner of the arena)
at the end of the match would earn them 3 points apiece. However, if a robot
gathered more than one token colour within their scoring zone, each token's
value drops from 3 points to 1 point. Full details of the game and the awards
available this year are available in the [rulebook][rulebook].

Our competition event this year was rather different to normal as COVID-19
prevented our usual weekend event. Instead the competition took place over
three weekends, with matches being live-streamed from within a simulator.
While this changed many aspects of the competition, the core challenge to create
an autonomous robot remained the same.

The Final
---------

This year's final featured four teams who had all proven their capabilities
throughout the competition. All robots got off to a strong start, though
JAMDynamics and Lawrence Sheriff School soon took a lead. However, later in the
match, the "poisoning" effect of having mixed tokens in a scoring zone changed
everything leaving all four teams with the same number of points.

This tie for first place lead to a tie-breaker match, played between the same
four teams though with their starting corners changed. Once again the
reliability of these four robots showed, with each collecting a token inside the
one minute mark. In the end it was JAMDynamics' robot which was able to collect
three silver tokens, including one stolen from Hills Road Sixth Form College
second team's scoring zone, which took victory.

While we weren't able to see them in person, we saw some brilliant robot designs
and were continually impressed by the progress made throughout the year, both
posted online and at the Tech Days. Even during the virtual competiton, it was
great to see the robot code improving week to week. We hope you enjoyed the
competition as much as we did!

With a dominating 111 league points, Kenilworth Sixth Form not only placed
highest among the rookie teams but placed highest overall in the league.
Especially given the changes to the competition through the year, beating other
more experienced teams is a remarkable feat.

The Committee Award is given for extraordinary ingenuity or simple elegance in
the design of their solution. Team SWI from South Wilts Grammar School earned
this prize for an impressive path-finding algorithm within their code. The
judges were additionally impressed by the clarity of the code and supporting
documentation, something which is easily overlooked when writing code. This also
showed in their robot's performance, which was reliably able to navigate around
the central pedestal to collect tokens from the far side.

We also encourage teams to share their progress towards their robots throughout
the year. Team MAI from Gymnasium Markt Indersdorf earned the Online Presence
Award for their ongoing blog posting during both the lead-up to the physical
competition and after lockdown began as well as for their activy on the forums.

For full details on all the awards, please see the [rulebook][rulebook].

Thanks

Of course, this competition would not be possible without the tireless work of
our volunteers, who developed the [simulated world][simulator] the competition
was run in and enabled us to switch to a virtual competiton. If you'd like to
get involved in organising future competitions, from developing the software and
hardware used by the teams to the events themselves we're always looking for
people to [join our team][volunteers].

Notes to editors
----------------

Student Robotics is an annual robotics competition for 16-18 year-olds in the UK
and Europe. It was founded in 2006 by university students and is free to enter
thanks to our sponsors and [many volunteers][volunteers]. Since it was first run
in 2008, the final competition has grown from one room at the University of
Southampton[^1] to the UK's biggest autonomous robotics competition.

[^1]: Student Robotics is independent from the University of Southampton.

At the start of the academic year, teams are given a kit containing custom-made
electronics at a Kickstart event, where the game for the year is announced. They
then have until the start of the Easter holiday to build fully-autonomous robots
which will compete against each other in the final competition. They are
supported by volunteer mentors, and software to assist them in programming their
robots is provided.

If you would like to find out more, please [get in touch][contactus].
