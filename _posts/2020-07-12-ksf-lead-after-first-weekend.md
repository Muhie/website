title: Kenilworth Sixth Form lead after the first weekend of matches
---

After the first 24 matches of the SR2020 Virtual Competition, team KSF from
Kenilworth Sixth Form head up the league leaderboard with 58 points. They're
closely followed by JAMDynamics and Lawrence Sheriff School.

The league matches provide a proving ground for all the teams' hard work over
the past few months in preparing their robot code. There is also a prize for the
rookie team which scores the best in the league, which the Kenilworth Sixth Form
and JAMDynamics teams are currently well placed for.

The teams now have a week to work on and improve their code before another 24
league matches are played over the course of next weekend. As we've seen with
the changes in the league from today's matches, this means there's still all to
play for.

If you would like to catch up on this weekend's livestreamed matches, they're

We look forward to seeing you over the next two weekends for the continuation of
the SR2020 Virtual Competition.
