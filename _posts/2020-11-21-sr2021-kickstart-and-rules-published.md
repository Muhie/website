title: SR2021 Game Announced
---

Student Robotics 2021 was Kickstarted today on our [livestream][livestream]. Peaking at just over a hundred concurrent viewers we welcomed teams from around the world, and it was great to see the competitors get familiar with the simulator.

Our game this year, _Radars of the Lost Ark_, challenges teams to score points by claiming territories using radios. Teams must navigate the arena scanning for tower transmissions and sending their own transmissions back to claim territories. Teams are awarded points at the end of the match for the maximum extent of their territory at any one time. Full details, including the prizes available this year, are available in the [rulebook][rules].

As this competition year doesn't feature a physical competition event, the
structure of the competition has changed. The league matches will take place on
four weekends through the year. After each league session the game will gain
additional modules that will present new and different challenges to the
competitors. The competition will culminate on May 1st 2021 with a the
[knockouts and grand final][knockouts-event].

This year's teams have already been strategising their approach, and we can't wait to see their progress over the year!

If you weren’t able to attend Kickstart this year, or would like a recap, you can:
