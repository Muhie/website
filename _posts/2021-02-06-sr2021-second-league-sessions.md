title: SR2021 Teams Show Progress in Second League Session
---

With another 36 matches of the SR2021 Competition, team HRS3 from Hills Road
Sixth Form College head up the league leaderboard, though a number of other
teams are hot on their heels. This weekend's matches saw great perfomances from
our teams, including three new teams which hadn't submitted a robot for the
first league sesion.

Module â…¡ provided a new challenge to the teams, both through opening up the
arena half way through the match and by requiring that territories be linked
back to a teams starting zone to be captured. The latter in particular created
some tense moments during the matches, with robots able to dramatically affect
each others' scores by severing territory chains.

At the end of the league we announced to teams the details of our
[third game module](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/resources/2021/rulebook.html).
This changes the way that a robot's score is calculated from being the largest
extent of their territory during the match to being purely based on the
territory they control at the end of the match. Additionally the territories
will now become locked (and unclaimed) after they have been successfully claimed
four times.

This module of the game requries that the teams robots further increase their
awawreness of their environment and how they react to it if they want to claim
territories and also hold them for the duration of the match

We're now at the half-way point in the league matches that will seed the evntual
knockout stage, so teams still have everything to play for. The next league
session will be in 6 weeks, on the 20th March.

If you would like to catch up on any of the matches so far, our livestreams are
