_In this new blog series we’ll be catching up with some of Student Robotics ex-competitors to see what they are now up to and how competing in Student Robotics has helped them to get there._

This week we’ll be catching up with Becky, who is now a PhD Student at Sussex Uni. Becky competed in SR2015 and SR2016 as a part of team CLY from Collyer's Sixth Form College.

#### How did you first get involved in Student Robotics?

My college had a Robotics club which I joined during my first year and we entered Student Robotics both years I was there. I helped with the mathematical parts of the code, as well as arguably the most important part of decorating the robot!

#### What are you doing now?

After completing my MSc in Maths, I am now doing a PhD in Maths at Sussex University. I am looking into batteries; what can we change to make them more effective, as well as epidemiology; how an infection will spread through groups of people and how long will the infection last.

#### How did Student Robotics help you get to where you are today?

Student Robotics has really helped me career wise, it's a great talking point, especially during interviews. Being able to work on a real world engineering project with a deadline was a fantastic experience.

#### What was your favourite part about competing in Student Robotics?

It gave me a solid group of friends that I'm still in contact with and we had great fun designing and building a robot together. It was also very satisfying watching our creation come to life. Once I left college, I started volunteering for Student Robotics and it's been just as fun and rewarding!

#### What advice would you give to yourself aged 16-18 knowing what you know now?

I wasn't very confident when I was younger and I was very nervous about joining clubs and activities. I've never regretted any of the things I did end up taking part in so my advice would be to not be afraid to join anything that looks interesting!
