title: SR2020 Competition Dates Announcement
---

We're pleased to announce this year's Competition dates and the first Tech Days of 2020.

## Competition Dates

The Student Robotics 2020 Competition will be held at Reading University on the 18th and 19th of April 2020.

These two days mark the ultimate stage of SR2020, showcasing the months of preparation. Our teams will work hard to push their robots to the limit and quickly make repairs between league matches. We will finish the weekend with the finals where the best bots will be named victorious.

As usual, we will require attendees to fill out a media consent form.

For more information, please see the Competition [event page][competition-event].

We hope to see all the teams and their robots at the Competition!

## Tech Days

Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their
robot with lots of help available. They're also an opportunity to see how other
teams are doing or get more direct help with their robots.

We provide a space for teams to work in, with power and internet access, as well
as volunteers able to help with the kits and hands-on guidance for the robots.

We have now confirmed the dates of some of the Tech Days in 2020.
These will be in Thread's offices at 1 Alie Street in London, on the following
Saturdays next year:

 * [25 January 2020]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/sr2020/london-tech-day-january/)
 * [29 February 2020]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/sr2020/london-tech-day-february/)
 * [28 March 2020]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/sr2020/london-tech-day-march/)

The London Tech Days will only run if there is sufficient interest, so please do
let us know if you'd like to attend. The deadlines for each are the Wednesday 10
days ahead of the event.
