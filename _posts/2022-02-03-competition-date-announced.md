title: SR2022 Competition Dates
---

We're pleased to announce this year's competition dates.

The Student Robotics 2022 competition will be held at Southampton University on the 23rd and 24th of April 2022.

These two days mark the culmination of a year's work, over which the teams have pulled together their design,
engineering, and programming skills. Our teams will work hard to push their robots to the limit, making
repairs between matches, and tweaking strategies as they learn about their competitors. We will finish the weekend with
the finals where the best bots will be named victorious.

For more information, please see the competition [event page][competition-event].

See you there!
