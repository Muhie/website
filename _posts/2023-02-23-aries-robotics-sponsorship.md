Student Robotics is excited to announce our new sponsor [Aries Robotics](https://ariesroboticsai.com/)! Their mission to generate more knowledge and accelerate innovation, health and prosperity for all aligns with our own mission to inspire the next generation of engineers and scientists.

Aries Robotics is a UK based company with divisions across a variety of sub-sectors within robotics as well as developing the worldâ€™s leading API-first robotics control, monitoring, and universal robotics operating system.

Student Robotics is entirely reliant on donations and the generosity of our sponsors. Aries Robotics' support will help us to continue to run our competition as a free to enter event, ensuring that as many teams as possible can participate. We're looking forward to working with them over the coming competition cycle, and send them our thanks.
