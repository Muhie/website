title: Transitioning to a Virtual Competition
---

In light of recent events, and the uncertainty it has brought, we're unfortunately cancelling the in-person competition for Student Robotics 2020. As mentioned before, we are still running a virtual competition.

The virtual competition event will take place over a few weekend sessions in July, with a few weekends of league matches, and a knockout final.

As we said in the previous email, we aim to keep the virtual competition rules as similar to Two Colours as possible so you can easily build on the work done since Kickstart.

We will be announcing the full details of the virtual competition early next week, and update the [event page]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/sr2020/virtual-competition/) accordingly.
