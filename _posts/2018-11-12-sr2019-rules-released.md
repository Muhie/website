title: SR2019 Rules Released & Useful Resources
---

We had a successful Kickstart on Saturday and it was great to see all the excited teams getting familiar with our kit.

Our game this year is called Caldera in which teams need to claim the most zones by placing more of their tokens than the enemy within the zone boundaries. ([full rules][rules])
We’ve already seen the teams come up with some innovative solutions and it’s going to be interesting to see how they develop.

All competitors should now have user accounts for the [IDE][ide]. (Please [contact us][contact] if you are not able to log in.)

[Our forums][forums] for this year are now live. This is a great place to brainstorm with other teams and discuss any problems which you run into.

If you weren’t able to attend Kickstart this year, or would like a recap, you can download:
- [The presentation][presentation] in which we explain this year’s game and how SR is running this year.
- [The microgames][microgames] which are small activities designed to let you become familiar with the Student Robotics kit.
