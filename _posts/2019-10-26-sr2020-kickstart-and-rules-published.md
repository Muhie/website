title: SR2020 Game Announced
---

Student Robotics 2020 was Kickstarted today simultaneously in three locations -- Cambridge, London and Southampton. Twenty-nine of the thirty-seven entered teams attended in person and it was great to see the teams getting familiar with the kits.

Our game this year, _Two Colours_, challenges team to score points by retrieving coloured tokens from on and around a raised platform in the centre of the arena. They must place these tokens within their scoring zone (i.e. their corner of the arena). However, if a team gathers more than one token colour within their scoring zone, each token's value drops from 3 points to 1 point. Full details, including the prizes available this year, are available in the [rulebook][rules].

This year's teams have already been strategising their approach, and we can't wait to see their progress over the year!

All competitors should now have user accounts for our website. This includes our [IDE][ide] where teams can write their code, and [our forums][forums] which are a great place to brainstorm with other teams and discuss any problems you run into.

(See [our docs][account-info] if you are not able to log in.)

If you weren’t able to attend Kickstart this year, or would like a recap, you can:

- watch our [livestream][livestream] where we explain the game and how this year's competition will work.
- download [the presentation][presentation] in which we explain this year’s game and how the competition is running this year.
- download [the microgames][microgames] which are small activities designed to let you become familiar with the Student Robotics kit.
