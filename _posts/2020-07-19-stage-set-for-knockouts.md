title: The stage is set for the SR2020 Knockouts
---

After two weekends and 48 matches, the league stage of the SR2020 Virtual
Competition is complete, setting the stage for the knockouts and the grand final
next weekend.

This weekend saw strong performances from a number of teams, including a number
of firsts: Kenilworth Sixth Form collected 5 tokens into their scoring zone in
one match and both Hills Road Sixth Form College's second team and JAMDynamics
stealing tokens from each others scoring zones.

Next weekend the teams will compete in the knockouts, which is the final test
for the teams' months of coding preparation. Once again the teams have a week to
work on and improve their robots before the 10am BST deadline to submit their
code ahead of the next set of matches.

The robots which perform best will make it through the Quarter-Finals to the
Semi-Finals and then to the grand Final of Student Robotics 2020. It remains
possible for any team to become the overall winners -- while the league scores
seed the knockouts, making progression easier for robots who scored well so far,
all teams will compete in the first round of the knockouts.

As well as prizes for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd places, teams are also competing
for a number of other awards, including the Committee Award (given to the team
that displays the most extraordinary ingenuity in their robot), and the Online
Presence Award (for the team that is judged to have the best online presence).
Full details of these awards and those for earlier stages of the competition are
available in our [rulebook](/docs/resources/2020/rulebook.pdf)
