That's a wrap on Student Robotics 2019! Our teams have been working hard since November to design, build, and test their robots; finally seeing the fruits of their work on the competition weekend. It was great to see our competitors quickly adapting their robots, from the physical design to the software, to overcome unforeseen challenges; giving themselves every small advantage towards claiming victory.

Our game this year, Caldera, challenged teams to control scoring zones with tokens while navigating an arena with raised platforms. Twenty-five scoring zones were arranged in a grid, varying in value from two points for each of the outermost 16 zones, a ring of eight on a raised “volcano” worth seven points apiece, to the the central “caldera” which was worth thirty points.

There were a few designs patterns this year. Many teams opted for tank tracks as a method of climbing the volcano. Instead of climbing the volcano, a few teams built catapult mechanisms with varying degrees of success. Others scooped up tokens and deposited them on the low scoring areas and/or the edge of the volcano.

The most notable designs were:

- Team TLC with their consistent, successful catapult.
- Team SWI with their simple and effective grab-and-go robot which climbed the volcano.
- Team CRB with their suction cup and catapult combination which unfortunately had technical issues for much of the competition.

Student Robotics 2019 concluded with an intense match between PSC, HAM, TLC, and HRS. Team HAM were quick off the mark pushing their tokens into the scoring zones. Team HRS soon followed, violently shoving their tokens across the arena. Team PSC's robot slowly moved 4 of their tokens into a single scoring zone before unfortunately flipping onto its back. Meanwhile, Team TLC quietly moved towards the edge of the volcano and launched a token directly into the Caldera. The action ended less than a minute into the match, and spectators were left mentally calculating the scores for the following 90 seconds.
